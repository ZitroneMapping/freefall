# Zitrone: Freefall #
A new look at the freefall series, that I adore so much. To be seen as an improved 2007 version, but started from scratch.

The common file format used is the .map format. The Valve Hammer Editor works better with its native .rmf format though, which is why you should follow these guidelines.
1. Open the .map file in Hammer
2. Save it as .rmf
3. Convert it to .map with [HLFix](http://extension.ws/hlfix/), NOT with Hammer
This way the file stays nice and clean.
